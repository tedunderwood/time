After all, Colorado had fewer than three hundred soldiers to protect the whole territory, and if the Indians wanted to pick off isolated farms, they could do so almost at will.\n \n On July 26, 1864, a rancher living east of the village of Zendt\u2019s Farm saw Indians making off with two of his cows, which they slaughtered four miles from his home. This time there was no uncertainty as to what had happened or who the culprits were, so once more Lieutenant Tanner and his riders scoured the prairie and once more they encountered a community of tipis pitched where they should not have been. It was hardly likely that the cow-stealers were lodged in this particular place, but Tanner and his men surrounded it and with a howitzer gunned down forty-seven Indians.\n", "narratedtime": 30240.0, "idx": 752, "subjectivetime": 0, "ellipsistime": 0, "complete": true, "ellipsisphrase": "", "subjectivephrase": ""}, {"text": "\n But finally Skimmerhorn tightened the noose, leaving the Pasquinels diminishing territory in which to maneuver, and one wintry morning along the Platte, about twenty miles east of Zendt\u2019s Farm, a detachment of militia surprised Jake and pinioned his arms before he could shoot himself.
