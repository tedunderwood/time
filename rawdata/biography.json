On this point the President said:\n \n In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to\n omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning\n despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here, that a general\n argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there\n is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most\n others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place\n _capital_ on an equal footing with, if not above, _labor_, in the\n structure of government. It is assumed that labor is available only\n in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody\n else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of it, induces him to\n labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that\n capital shall _hire_ laborers, and thus induce them to work by\n their own consent, or _buy_ them, and drive them to it without\n their consent.

Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from\n them are groundless. Labor is prior to and independent of capital.\n Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if\n labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and\n deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights,\n which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it\n denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation\n between labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is\n in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that\n relation. A few men own capital, and those few avoid labor\n themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to\n labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither\n work for others, nor have others working for them.

His father is there stiled Gentleman, a circumstance of which an ignorant panegyrist has praised him for not being proud; when the truth is, that the appellation of Gentleman, though now lost in the indiscriminate assumption of Esquire, was commonly taken by those who could not boast of gentility. His father was Michael Johnson, a native of Derbyshire, of obscure extraction, who settled in Lichfield as a bookseller and stationer. His mother was Sarah Ford, descended of an ancient race of substantial yeomanry in Warwickshire. They were well advanced in years when they married, and never had more than two children, both sons; Samuel, their first born, who lived to be the illustrious character whose various excellence I am to endeavour to record, and Nathanael, who died in his twenty-fifth year.\n", "narratedtime": 10512000.0, "complete": true, "ellipsistime": 0, "ellipsisphrase": "", "idx": 0, "subjectivetime": 0, "subjectivephrase": ""}, {"text": "Mr. Michael Johnson was a man of a large and robust body, and of a strong and active mind; yet, as in the most solid rocks veins of unsound substance are often discovered, there was in him a mixture of that disease, the nature of which eludes the most minute enquiry, though the effects are well known to be a weariness of life, an unconcern about those things which agitate the greater part of mankind, and a general sensation of gloomy wretchedness. From him then his son inherited, with some other qualities, 'a vile melancholy,' which in his too strong expression of any disturbance of the mind, 'made him mad all his life, at least not sober.' Michael was, however, forced by the narrowness of his circumstances to be very diligent in business, not only in his shop, but by occasionally resorting to several towns in the neighbourhood, some of which were at a considerable distance from Lichfield. At that time booksellers' shops in the provincial towns of England were very rare, so that there was not one even in Birmingham, in which town old Mr. Johnson used to open a shop every market-day. He was a pretty good Latin scholar, and a citizen so creditable as to be made one of the magistrates of Lichfield; and, being a man of good sense, and skill in his trade, he acquired a reasonable share of wealth, of which however he afterwards lost the greatest part, by engaging unsuccessfully in a manufacture of parchment.
