Always the first in the pursuit, it was several minutes before he was overtaken by his companions, who, when they lifted him up, immediately perceived his leg was broken. One of\n \n his attendants then set off full speed for the village, and immediately returned with a sort of litter, on which he was borne to Warrington Castle; and as a surgeon from the next town had been sent for at the same time, he arrived almost as soon as the Baronet; and having set his leg, and declared the fracture by no means a dangerous one, he took leave, desiring his patient might be kept as quiet as possible.\n The character of our hero might more properly be termed a mixture of good qualities and foibles, than of virtues and vices: as he had more of the latter in his composition; and the\n \n former, from the peculiarities of his education, though numerous, were inactive. To account for this, it will be necessary, before I enter on the events of his own life, to mention some particulars of his father.\n", "ellipsistime": 0, "idx": 0, "complete": true}, {"subjectivetime": 0, "ellipsisphrase": "", "subjectivephrase": "", "narratedtime": 15768000.0, "text": "Sir Thomas Warrington was a mere country squire, without abilities and without improvement.

Perhaps Sir Thomas would not have been the\n \n man of her choice, had her situation been either an independent or a happy one; but the tyranny of a mother-in-law, and the certainty of comparative poverty on the death of her father, whose vices and extravagance had equally impaired his fortune and his constitution, induced her to comply with the Baronet's proposals, who, it must be observed, appeared to her in a very different light at that time; as his person was handsome, and his address, though far from elegant, had in it more of rusticity than vulgarity; and the cheerfulness of his conversation concealed in some measure the inferiority of his understanding.

Her time therefore was chiefly devoted to the education of George, our present hero, the only child she ever had; and she impressed on his tender mind those sentiments of generosity, humanity, and religion, which he never lost, though the advice and example of his father for some years prevented their effects.\n \n He was scarcely twelve when this exemplary mother was taken from him; and he felt her loss as severely as such a child could feel. Sir Thomas, who, in his way, really loved her, lamented her at first with that violence so natural to him, and which always exhausts itself: of course, when the first emotions of grief were subsided, he not merely grew calm, but suffered himself to be consoled by the reflection, that, had she lived, Lady Warrington would have made a milksop of his boy.

But for the most reckless\n among the reckless, for the spendthrift among spendthrifts, for the\n gamester above all gamesters, and for a gay man outstripping the gay--by\n these characteristics did the world know Lord Mount Severn.
