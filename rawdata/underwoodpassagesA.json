G. Geiger\u2019s place was a store frontage on the north side of the boulevard near Las Palmas. The entrance door was set far back in the middle and there was a copper trim on the windows, which were backed with Chinese screens, so I couldn\u2019t see into the store. There was a lot of oriental junk in the windows. I didn\u2019t know whether it was any good, not being a collector of antiques, except unpaid bills. The entrance door was plate glass, but I couldn\u2019t see much through that either, because the store was very dim. A building entrance adjoined it on one side and on the other was a glittering credit jewelry establishment. The jeweler stood in his entrance, teetering on his heels and looking bored, a tall handsome white-haired Jew in lean dark clothes, with about nine carats of diamond on his right hand. A faint knowing smile curved his lips when I turned into Geiger\u2019s store. I let the door close softly behind me and walked on a thick blue rug that paved the floor from wall to wall. There were blue leather easy chairs with smoke stands beside them. A few sets of tooled leather bindings were set out on narrow polished tables, between book ends. There were more tooled bindings in glass cases on the walls. Nice-looking merchandise, the kind a rich promoter would buy by the yard and have somebody paste his bookplate in. At the back there was a grained wood partition with a door in the middle of it, shut. In the corner made by the partition and one wall a woman sat behind a small desk with a carved wooden lantern on it.\n", "idx": 22, "narratedtime": 1.0, "subjectivetime": 0, "ellipsisphrase": "", "complete": true, "ellipsistime": 0, "subjectivephrase": ""}, {"text": "\n \u201cMaybe it just isn\u2019t your day.

But her\n death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\n into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\n inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\n bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\n children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  His\n attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and\n Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n children added a relish to his existence.\n", "idx": 0, "narratedtime": 105120000.0, "subjectivetime": 0, "ellipsisphrase": "", "complete": true, "ellipsistime": 0, "subjectivephrase": ""}, {"text": "\n By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n lady, three daughters.

A RAILING.\n THE next morning the family purposed setting off as soon as breakfast was over: young Delvile, however, waited not so long; the fineness of the weather tempted him, he said, to travel on horseback, and therefore he had risen very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not but wonder, yet did not repine.\n Just as breakfast was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Delvile and Cecilia were preparing to depart, to their no little surprise, the door was opened, and, out of breath with haste and with heat, in stumpt Mr. Briggs! \"So,\" cried he, to Cecilia, \"what's all this? hay? where are going? a coach at the door! horses to every wheel!

She knew she could. There had never been a man she couldn\u2019t get, once she set her mind upon him.\n \n \u201cI\u2019ll think of it all tomorrow, at Tara. I can stand it then. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll think of some way to get him back.
